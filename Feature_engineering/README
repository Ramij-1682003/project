Executive Summary
 Evoastra has been engaged by a leading telecommunications client to develop a sophisticated machine learning
 solution for predicting market-level churn across different geographic regions and operator segments. This
 project represents a strategic initiative to transform reactive market management into proactive competitive
 intelligence.
 The telecommunications industry faces intense competition with operators constantly gaining and losing market
 share across different regions. Market share erosion in key circles can lead to significant revenue losses and
 reduced competitive positioning. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts which
 operator-circle combinations are at risk of subscriber decline (market churn), enabling proactive retention and
 competitive strategies.
 Unlike traditional customer-level churn prediction, this project focuses on market-level churn - predicting when
 telecom operators will lose substantial subscriber base in specific geographic regions. This approach provides
 strategic insights for network investment, marketing allocation, and competitive positioning
